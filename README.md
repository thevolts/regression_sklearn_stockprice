# Results:
As you can see in the Notebook outcomes, even though the designs do not seem to be too bad, they do. So if you look closer, they're just imitating what's going on the day before. We can see from this that a model of regression is not good enough to predict inventory prices. In order to do this, you should attempt using other models and most importantly not enough to use only previous inventory information. To enhance the template, you can attempt using Sentiment Analysis on twitter or news information.
